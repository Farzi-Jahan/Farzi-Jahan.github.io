<h1> Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</h1>
<p> Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by J. K. Rowling. The books are based on a young wizard’s life whose name is Harry Potter. Harry finds out that he is a wizard when at the age of eleven he gets invited at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main themes of the novels are  Harry’s and his friends’ lives at school and also outside of the school, and their never ending struggles with dark magic and a dark wizard called Lord Voldemort, who is Harry’s number one enemy and wants Harry dead. There are seven books in this series and each of them represent one year of Harry’s life at Hogwarts.</p>
<p> I have read all seven books. All of these novels have their own dark parts, but when we reach towards the end of the series, it seems that the darkness appears more often. I also once read that the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, is the darkest book among the series. So, I decided to conduct a discourse analysis using Voyant tools to discover if the sixth book is the darkest one in the series or not.</p>
<p> At first I tried to look through the most frequently used words in the books, but it did not work. I tried to eliminate some words using the Blacklist tool, but there were too many words to cut out. So, I decided to use the Whitelist tool and try to look for the words that I think they represent darkness in J. K. Rowling’s books. To determine the words for the Whitelist, at first I tried the ones that I could remember from reading the books, and then I read some passages from the sixth book and came up with more keywords for my search.</p>
<p> I used these words to do the analysis: chilly, faceless, harsh, bleak, terrorize, shiver, injured, crude, injury, silence, unnerve, unnerving, darkness, dead body, horrible, cold, greenish, scared, worrisome, kill, pain, danger, terrified, scream, torture, hurt, anguish, die, anxious, worried, fear, raucous, pallid, morose, rankle, onerous, deprave, vindictive, tentative, discomfit, dudgeon, dark, sad, dead, death, dark lord, fight, war, unpleasant, surreptitious, aggrieve, admonition.</p>
<p> I had to take out one of my keywords which is “black”. However, in my opinion J. K. Rowling uses this word to describe dark, mysterious, deadly places (for example when she describes the location of the cave in the sixth book chapter 26 where Harry and Dumbledore are looking for one of the Horcruxes), I could not get reliable results from this search because the last name of one of the main characters in the books is Black.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By looking up different keywords, and some specific words that I believe they represent darkness in Harry Potter series, I came to realize that the seventh book, Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, is the darkest one in the series.</p>
<p>I think it was only my personal assumption that the sixth book is the darkest one in the series. One of the reasons can be that as a reader, when I first read the sixth book, it was the first time that I encountered that much gloominess in the novels, and it seems that by the time I read the seventh book, I was ready for that level of darkness in the story.</p>
<p>Although it is obvious from the results that the sixth book also has the elements of the darkness, the seventh book represents these elements more often. However, I believe only using a Voyant tools cannot analyze this issue in depth, and for more reliable results, this study needs a second form of discourse analysis as well.</p>
